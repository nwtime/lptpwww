### Getting the Code

You can download the latest released version at [Source Forge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxptp/files/latest/download).

The source code is managed using the git version control system. To
get your own copy of the project sources, use the following command.

`git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/linuxptp/code linuxptp`

If the git protocol is blocked by your local area network, then you
can use the alternative HTTP protocol instead.

`git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/linuxptp/code linuxptp`
