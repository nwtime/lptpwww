title: "Welcome to The Linux PTP Project"
---

This software is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux. The dual design goals are to
provide a robust implementation of the standard and to use the most relevant and modern Application Programming Interfaces (API) offered by the Linux
kernel. Supporting legacy APIs and other platforms is not a goal.

Network Time Foundation provides support for the NTP Project and hosts the [PTP Consortium](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/).
